# Uncloud

Uncloud is a lightweight tool for deploying and managing containerised applications across a network of Docker hosts. It
bridges the gap between simple Docker deployments and complex cloud platforms and container orchestrators like
Kubernetes.

Our goal is to become the go-to self-hosted alternative to platforms like [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and
[Render](https://render.com/). Whether you're using bare metal servers, Raspberry Pis, or cloud VMs, Uncloud transforms
your hardware into a personal cloud platform.
