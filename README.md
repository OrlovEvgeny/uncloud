  <h1>Uncloud</h2>
  A lightweight Docker clustering tool for running web apps on your own servers ‚Äî from cloud VMs to bare metal.<br>
  Replace Heroku and Render, no Kubernetes required.
</div>

## Quick start

1. Install Uncloud CLI:

```bash
curl -fsS https://get.uncloud.run | sh
```

2. Initialize your first machine:

```bash
uc machine init root@your-server-ip
```

3. Create a DNS A record pointing `app.example.com` to your server's IP address, then deploy your app with
   automatic HTTPS:

```bash
uc run --name my-app -p app.example.com:8000/https registry/app
```

That's it! Your app is now running and accessible at https://app.example.com ‚ú®
