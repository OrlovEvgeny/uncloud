ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! This page is still being written. I'm working hard to get all the documentation ready, but there's a lot to
cover and I want to make sure it's actually helpful rather than rushing it out with LLM slop.

In the meantime, if you need help you have questions, please jump into our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/eR35KQJhPu). We're a friendly bunch and always happy to help troubleshoot issues or
answer questions!

Thanks for your patience as I get the docs into shape.
